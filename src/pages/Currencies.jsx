        There are many different options you can take advantage of when betting at an online gaming site that accepts crypto currencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different crypto currencies have different advantages and disadvantages. On this page, we will examine the key differences between the crypto currencies you can bet with.
      </p>
      <p>
        We look at transaction processing time and consider processing cost by blockchain. We will then examine the key crypto currencies used in{" "}
        <a href="#">crypto betting sites</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 className="fw-bold" id='ProcessingSpeeds'>Processing Speeds</h3>
      <p>
        A key factor when choosing which currency to deposit and withdraw is processing time. Transactions on different blockchains take different times to be recorded as each network uses separate protocols for validating and finalizing transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Layer-1 blockchains are the base networks such as Bitcoin, BNB Chain, or Ethereum, and related infrastructure. Layer 1 blockchains can validate and finalize transactions without confirmation from another source. As developers have entered the crypto currency space, Level 2 protocols have been built which seek to improve scalability. They allow users to make transactions quickly and then record these onto the Layer-1 blockchain. Bitcoin Lightning is an example of a Level 2 protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Table 1 below shows illustrative transaction confirmation processing speeds by crypto currency. For example: Bitcoin can take up to 40 minutes to confirm, whilst Ripple is near-instant.

        <h3 className="fw-bold" id='Bitcoin'>Bitcoin</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#">Bitcoin</a> is a cryptocurrency, or virtual currency, that operates as fiat money and a form of payment while being independent of any one person, organisation, or institution, negating the need for third-party participation in financial transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is given to blockchain miners in return for their efforts in verifying transactions and can be bought on numerous platforms.
        </p>

      {/* Ethereum */}
      <div className="crypto-section">
        <h3 className="fw-bold" id='Ethereum'>Ethereum</h3>
        <p>
          The open-source platform <a href="#">Ethereum</a> was established in 2015 and is available to programmers for the creation of new coins and digital applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          ETH is the trading identifier for Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether, although Ethereum is essentially a specialised blockchain technology, the decentralised distributed digital ledger that keeps account of all transactions.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Litecoin */}
      <div className="crypto-section">
        <h3 className="fw-bold" id='Litecoin'>Litecoin</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#">Litecoin</a> is a cryptocurrency that was founded in 2011 as a result of a split in the Bitcoin network.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was created to address developers' worries that Bitcoin was becoming too centralised, and to make it more difficult for large-scale mining companies to obtain an advantage in mining.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite failing to prevent commercial miners from capturing the majority of Litecoin mining, the cryptocurrency has evolved into a peer-to-peer payment system and mineable coin, like Bitcoin.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Dogecoin */}
      <div className="crypto-section">
        <h3 className="fw-bold" id='Dogecoin'>Dogecoin</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#">Dogecoin</a> is a cryptocurrency based on the Doge meme, which depicts a Shiba Inu dog with colourful Comic Sans texts intended to reflect its internet monologue.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dogecoin sprang to prominence towards the end of 2013 at a time when developers were only starting to explore the possibilities given by the development of Bitcoin (BTC).
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Binance */}
      <div className="crypto-section">
        <h3 className="fw-bold" id='Binance'>Binance</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#">Binance</a> introduced its Binance Coin (BNB) as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum in 2017 and held an ICO to raise funds. The firm provided angel investors 10% of the stock, the founding team 40% of the stock, and the rest of the stock to the general public.
        </p>
        <p>
          The currency is a Binance utility token that enables users to pay for transactions and trading fees at a lesser rate than they might with other currencies.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Monero */}
      <div className="crypto-section">
        <h3 className="fw-bold">Monero</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#">Monero</a> (abbreviated as XMR) is a privacy-focused open-source cryptocurrency that was created in 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blockchains, the underlying technology that supports digital currencies, are public ledgers of users' activity that display all of the networkâ€™s transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moneroâ€™s blockchain has been designed to be as secretive as possible. By masking the addresses used by members, it makes transaction data such as the identities of senders and receivers, as well as the value of each transaction, anonymous.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* XRP */}
      <div className="crypto-section">
        <h3 className="fw-bold">XRP</h3>
        <p>
          Ripple, or <a href="#">XRP</a>, is a payments resolution system and currency exchange network that can handle transactions from all around the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The theory is that Ripple acts as a trusted intermediary between two parties in a transaction, since the network can instantly verify that the transaction was completed successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ripple allows for the exchange of fiat currency, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and even commodities such as gold.

        </p>
        <p>
          The EOS platform was introduced in June 2018 and Block.one, the business that built the open-source software called EOS.IO that is utilised on the network, raised $4.1 billion in cryptocurrency via an initial coin offering.
        </p>

      {/* Tron */}
      <div className="crypto-section">

        <p>
          Tronix, or <a href="#">TRX</a>, is the currency of <a href="#">Tron</a> - a blockchain-based decentralised digital platform, similar to Ethereum and Ether.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tron, which was founded in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, a Singapore non-profit organisation, seeks to host a worldwide entertainment system for the cost-effective distribution of digital material.
        </p>
        <p>
          TRX eventually became a worldwide currency after first being sold exclusively in Asia. At the start of this year, the platform had more than 50 million users.

      {/* Tether */}

        <h3 className="fw-bold" id='Tether'>Tether</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#">Tether</a>, like Bitcoin, is a cryptocurrency and is the worldâ€™s third-largest digital currency in terms of market value. However, it does differ from Bitcoin and other virtual currencies in the following way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tether is a "stablecoin", which unlike other cryptocurrencies, which are known to be volatile, these are digital currencies that are tethered to real-world assets like the US dollar to preserve a steady value.
        </p>

      {/* Cardano */}
      <div className="crypto-section">

        </p>
        <p>
          This will open the door to the creation of a variety of decentralised banking applications, new crypto assets, games, and more.
