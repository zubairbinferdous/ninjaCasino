      <h2 className="fw-bold" id="Stake">How To Claim GGPoker Promo Code</h2>
      <p>
        Finding a new gambling site is exciting enough, but when there is a promo code available to make the most of it, it takes that excitement to a whole new level. <br /><br />
        Not only is there the prospect of finding new favourite games to play, but there‚Äôs also the chance of being able to make some serious bonus profits while playing them. <br /><br />
        Promo codes are offered by online casinos and poker sites as a way of enticing new customers, and those customers that know how to use them the right way can make this opportunity particularly lucrative. <br /><br />
        They can grant a number of different bonus types, including deposit bonuses, no deposit bonuses, free spins, and more, and we‚Äôll go into a bit more detail about these later. <br /><br />
        On this page, you‚Äôll find all the information you need about crypto poker promo codes, including where to find them and how to use them.
      </p>

      <h3 className="fw-bold" id="Conditions">Important Terms And Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        Promo code welcome bonuses will always come hand-in-hand with a set of terms and conditions that essentially provide you with the instructions you need in order to qualify for the promotion. <br /><br />
        The most important of these terms and conditions will usually include minimum deposits, minimum wagers, restricted games, restricted deposit methods, wagering requirements, and how long you have until the promotion expires after you create your account. <br /><br />
        You will also need to be creating your first new account with the poker site and be of the legal gambling age in your region.
      </p>

      <h3 className="fw-bold" id="Requirements">Promo Code Wagering Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        If you‚Äôve yet to encounter wagering requirements, it‚Äôs important that you become familiar with what they are and how they work. <br /><br />
        Particularly with poker and betting sites, you‚Äôll find that any time something is given for free, there will be strings attached. With bonus funds and free spins, this usually means wagering requirements. <br /><br />
        Wagering requirements state how many times you have to play through the bonus amount before it can be withdrawn as cash.
      </p>

      <h3 className="fw-bold" id="Currencies">Supported Currencies</h3>
      <p>As a crypto poker site, GGPoker accepts a decent range of cryptocurrencies as payment options.</p>

        Bitcoin Cash <br />
        Ethereum <br />
        Litecoin <br />
        Dogecoin <br />
        Tron <br />
        Ripple <br />
        Even though these are the cryptocurrencies that you are depositing and playing with, you will notice that your playing funds will still be displayed as the value of your crypto in GBP, USD, or EUR.
      </p>
